# Student Profile Menu Restoration - Complete ✅

## Problem
The user requested to restore the student profile menu item that was previously removed from the Student Menu screen.

## Solution Implemented
Added the "Student Profile" menu item back to the student section in the More menu screen.

  icon: Icons.person,
  title: 'Student Profile',

  onTap: () => Navigator.push(
