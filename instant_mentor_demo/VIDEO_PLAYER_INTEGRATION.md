# Session Video Player Integration

## Overview
The session notes now include a fully functional video player that can stream session recordings. The video player supports:

- **Play/Pause controls**
- **Seek functionality** with progress slider
- **Duration display** (current time / total time)
- **Responsive design** that adapts to video aspect ratio
- **Touch controls** (tap to show/hide controls)
- **Error handling** with fallback demo player

## Features

### 1. Real Video Playback
- Supports network video URLs (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Uses Flutter's `video_player` package for reliable playback
- Automatically detects video aspect ratio and adjusts display

### 2. Professional UI
- Modal dialog with header showing session title
- Gradient overlay controls that fade in/out
- Clean, modern design matching the app's aesthetic
- Responsive sizing (max 800x600 with constraints)

### 3. Demo Mode
- When no video URL is provided, shows demo interface
- Includes sample video functionality
- Clear messaging about production video integration

## How It Works

### 1. Session Notes Model
```dart
class SessionNote {
  final String? videoUrl;  // New field for video recording URL
  final bool hasRecording; // Determines if "Watch Recording" button shows
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Video Player Component
- Located in `lib/features/student/notes/session_video_player.dart`
- Self-contained widget that handles all video functionality
- Automatically initializes and manages video controller lifecycle

### 3. Integration Points
- Session notes screen shows "Watch Recording" button when `hasRecording = true`
- Clicking button opens video player dialog with session title and video URL
- Video player handles loading, error states, and playback controls

## Testing

### Demo Videos Available:
1. **Calculus Integration session**: Flutter bee sample video
2. **Quantum Mechanics session**: Sample video URL (may require internet)

### How to Test:
1. Run the app and navigate to "Session Notes"
2. Look for notes with red "REC" badges
3. Click "Watch Recording" button
4. Video player dialog should open with playback controls

## Production Integration

### To integrate with your video storage service:

1. **Update SessionNote creation** to include video URLs from your backend
2. **Modify video URLs** to point to your video storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud, etc.)
3. **Add authentication** if your videos require access tokens
4. **Implement video uploading** when sessions are recorded

### Example backend integration:
```dart
// When creating notes from backend data
SessionNote(
  // ... other fields
  hasRecording: sessionData['has_recording'] ?? false,
  videoUrl: sessionData['recording_url'], // From your video service
)
```

## Technical Details

### Video Player Features:
- **Cross-platform**: Works on web, mobile, and desktop
- **Network streaming**: Supports HTTP/HTTPS video URLs
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when videos fail to load
- **Memory management**: Properly disposes controllers to prevent leaks

### Supported Video Formats:
- MP4 (recommended)
- WebM (web)
- MOV (mobile)
- Other formats supported by platform video players

## Notes

- Video loading requires internet connectivity
- Large videos may take time to buffer
- Consider implementing video thumbnails for better UX
- Add video quality selection for different bandwidth conditions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production:
- Video thumbnails/previews
- Playback speed controls
- Fullscreen mode
- Video chapters/timestamps
- Offline video caching
- Video quality selection
- Closed captions support
