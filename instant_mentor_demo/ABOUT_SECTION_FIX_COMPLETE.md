# About Section Settings Fix - Complete Implementation

## Issue Fixed
The "About" section buttons (Check Updates, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Rate App) were showing basic UI elements but lacking comprehensive functionality and meaningful content.

## Root Cause
The About section methods had placeholder implementations:
- Check Updates: Showed fake "latest version" without real app info
- Terms of Service: Only showed "Terms of service coming soon!" message
- Privacy Policy: Only showed "Privacy policy coming soon!" message  
- Rate App: Basic star rating without proper feedback flow
