# Help Center - Interactive Help Topics Implementation

## Issue Fixed
The Help Center dialog displayed help topics but they were not clickable/interactive. Users couldn't read detailed information about each topic, making the help system non-functional.

Added `onTap` handlers to each `ListTile`:
```dart
onTap: () {
  Navigator.pop(ctx);
  _showHelpTopicDetails(context, helpTopics[i]);
}
```

#### 3. Created Detailed View Dialog
New method `_showHelpTopicDetails()` that:
