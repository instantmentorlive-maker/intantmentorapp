# Dark Mode Fix - Complete Implementation

## Issue Fixed
The dark mode toggle in Settings was showing "Theme will change on app restart" and not working immediately.

## Root Cause
The app had a hardcoded light theme in `main.dart` and wasn't watching the `darkModeProvider` to switch themes dynamically.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced MaterialApp Theme Configuration
**File:** `lib/main.dart`

- **Added import** for `persistent_settings_provider.dart`
- **Added `darkModeProvider` watcher** in `MyApp.build()` method
- **Created complete dark theme** with proper color scheme for dark mode
- **Added `themeMode` property** that switches between light/dark based on provider state

### 2. Updated Settings Screen Feedback
**File:** `lib/features/shared/settings/settings_screen.dart`

- **Changed snackbar message** from "Theme will change on app restart" to "Theme changed successfully"
- **Immediate theme switching** now works without restart

## Theme Details

### Light Theme
- Primary: Blue (#2563EB)
- Secondary: Deep Navy (#0B1C49)
- Background: Light gray (#F8FAFC)
- Cards: White with subtle shadow

### Dark Theme
- Primary: Lighter blue (#3B82F6) for better contrast
- Secondary: Dark gray (#1E293B)
- Background: Very dark blue (#020617)
- Cards: Dark gray (#1E293B) with enhanced shadow

## User Experience
✅ **Instant theme switching** - No app restart required
✅ **Persistent preference** - Setting saved and restored on app restart
✅ **Proper contrast** - All UI elements readable in both modes
✅ **Consistent styling** - Same design language in both themes

## Testing
1. Open Settings screen
2. Toggle "Dark Mode" switch
3. ✅ Theme changes immediately
4. ✅ Shows "Theme changed successfully" message
5. ✅ Setting persists after app restart

The dark mode implementation is now fully functional and provides a seamless user experience.
