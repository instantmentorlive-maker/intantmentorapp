# Instant Call Payment Flow Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete instant call flow where clicking the "Instant Call" button first opens a payment page, then proceeds to the video call after successful payment.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modified `find_mentors_screen.dart`
- **Updated `_startInstantCall()` method**: Now calls `_showPaymentSheet()` instead of directly navigating to video call
- **Added `_showPaymentSheet()` method**: Displays a modal bottom sheet with payment details
- **Added `_processPaymentAndStartCall()` method**: Handles payment processing simulation and navigation to video call

### 2. Enhanced `payment_checkout_sheet.dart`
- **Improved UI design**: Added video call icon and green styling
- **Enhanced button text**: Changed to "Pay & Start Call" for clarity
- **Demo mode indicator**: Added "Demo mode" text to indicate simulation

## Flow Sequence

1. **User clicks "Instant Call" button** on mentor card
2. **Payment sheet opens** showing:
   - Mentor name
   - Hourly rate ($55/hour for example)
   - Session duration (30 minutes)
   - Prorated cost ($27.50 for 30 minutes)
   - Total amount due
   - "Pay & Start Call" and "Cancel" buttons

3. **User clicks "Pay & Start Call"**
4. **Payment processing dialog** appears showing:
   - Loading spinner
   - "Processing payment of $27.50..."
   - "Demo mode - payment simulation"

5. **Payment success dialog** shows:
   - Green checkmark
   - Payment confirmation details
   - "Starting video call..." message

6. **Navigation to video call** with session parameters:
   - Session ID
   - Mentor details
   - Payment status: 'paid'
   - Session duration: 30 minutes

7. **Success notification** appears:
   - Green snackbar with "ðŸŽ¥ Video call started with [Mentor Name]!"

## Key Features

### Payment Details Calculation
- **Hourly Rate**: Pulled from mentor data
- **Session Duration**: Default 30 minutes for instant calls
- **Prorated Amount**: Calculated as `(hourlyRate / 60) * minutes`

### Error Handling
- **Payment Processing Errors**: Shows error dialog with retry option
- **Navigation Safety**: All navigation checks for `context.mounted`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to error messages if payment fails

### User Experience
- **Clear Visual Flow**: Icons and colors guide the user through the process
- **Loading States**: Shows progress during payment processing
- **Confirmation Steps**: Multiple confirmation points prevent accidental charges
- **Demo Mode**: Clearly indicates this is a simulation

## Testing
Created comprehensive test file `instant_call_flow_test.dart` with tests for:
- Payment sheet appearance on instant call click
- Payment details accuracy
- Flow completion to video call
- Error handling scenarios

## Technical Implementation
- **Async/Await**: Proper handling of asynchronous operations
- **Context Safety**: Checks for mounted context before navigation
- **Modal Dialogs**: Uses modal bottom sheets and dialogs for clean UX
- **State Management**: Maintains payment and session state throughout flow
- **Route Parameters**: Passes payment and session data to video call screen

## Demo Features
- **Simulated Payment**: 3-second delay to simulate real payment processing
- **Mock Data**: Uses mentor data from the existing demo mentors list
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading spinners, success/error states
- **No External Dependencies**: Works without real payment gateways for demo

## Files Modified
1. `lib/features/student/find_mentors/find_mentors_screen.dart`
2. `lib/features/payments/payment_checkout_sheet.dart`
3. `test/instant_call_flow_test.dart` (created)

## Usage
1. Run the app: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Navigate to "Find Mentors" screen
3. Look for mentors marked as "Available Now" (green dot)
4. Click the "Instant Call" button
5. Follow the payment flow to experience the complete feature

The implementation successfully creates a professional instant call flow that guides users through payment before connecting them to video calls with mentors.
